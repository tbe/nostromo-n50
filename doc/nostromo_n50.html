<BODY LANG="en-US">
<H1 CLASS="western">Introduction</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The nostromo_n50 configuration tools
are designed to support the excellent Belkin Nostromo n50 speedpad
for playing games under the X Window system. The tools consist of a
configuration GUI and a daemon process. The GUI is used to configure
sets of key mappings and select the current map, and the daemon
translates Nostromo key hits to X events.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The tools support multiple
configurations, so you can have different mappings for the same game
or completely different mappings for different games. All you have to
do is select the configuration you want from the GUI.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Nostromo Modes</H2>
<P>The Nostromo n50 (as you may have noticed) has three lights
towards the front left corner of the device. These can be used to
flag different 'modes' of operation for the device. The easiest way
to handle the modes is to think of the lights representing four
different modes &ndash; one for each color light and 'normal' mode in
which no lights are on. Buttons can be mapped to 'shift' into a mode
&ndash; where the device flips modes only while the button is
pressed, then returns to its previous mode. Buttons can also be
mapped to 'lock' a mode, in which the device is flipped to a
different mode. The lights will be toggled to always reflect which
mode the device is in. The modes can be useful in more complex
configurations where entirely different sets of keys are needed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 0.05cm; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
Note: When using the modes always remember to map not only keys that
change to a different mode (normal -&gt; red) but also keys to get
back, otherwise you can easily get stuck in a mode with no way to get
back to normal!</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">The Configuration GUI</H1>
<P><IMG SRC="main_window.png" NAME="Graphic3" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=228 HEIGHT=428 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT>The
main bit that will greet you is the configuration GUI. It's a happy
little bundle of buttons that lets you set up the way you want the
Nostromo to behave. The configuration GUI stores its information in a
file called <FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">.nostromorc_n50</FONT> in
your home directory.</P>
<P>The major pieces are the configuration selection, the key mappings
and at the bottom the Exit button. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">The Configuration Selection</H2>
<P>The Nostromo n50 tools support multiple configurations, this
control selects the current configuration from those defined. When
you exit the GUI this is stored as the Current Configuration.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Managing Multiple Configurations</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western">Setting the Current Configuration</H3>
<P>Simply select a configuration in the &ldquo;Current Configuration&rdquo;
list to set that as the current configuration for configuration or
use by the daemon.</P>
<P>Pressing the <B><I>Apply </I></B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">button
saves the configuration and signals the nostromo_daemon process to
reread the configuration file.</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">The
nostromo_daemon process is launched or signalled to reread its
configuration when <B><I>Save &amp; Exit</I></B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
is pressed to exit the configuration GUI.</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="new_dialog.png" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=213 HEIGHT=178 BORDER=0>Creating
a configuration</H3>
<P>To create a configuration, select the <I>New configuration</I>
option from the <I>Configs</I> menu. If you already have a
configuration that you want to use as a starting point, you can
select it and the newly created configuration will be a copy.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Renaming a configuration</H3>
<P>If you select <I>Rename configuration</I> from the <I>Configs</I>
menu the app will prompt you for a new name for the configuration.
This is a good time to correct that embarrassing spelling mistake
that inevitably creeps in.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Deleting a configuration</H3>
<P>Select <I>Delete Configuration</I> from the <I>Configs</I> menu to
delete a configuration. <B><I>Caution: This is permanent.</I></B></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Key Mappings</H2>
<P>There are buttons for each of the 10 main Nostromo keys, plus the
thumb pad. Selecting any of the buttons brings up the current details
for that key.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Key Name</H3>
<P>Each key can have a custom label associated it, to remind you what
the key is intended to do.</P>
<P>Below that is the list of keys mapped to the currently selected
key. Using the Set button allows you to configure the keys that map
to the current button.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Key Type</H3>
<P>Since there are a number of strange things that may need to be
mapped to a Nostromo key (I usually map the Shift key to one of the
thumbpad positions) there is a Key Type list to select what the key
is for:</P>
